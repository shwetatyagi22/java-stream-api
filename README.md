Stream is a sequence of elements that supports sequential and parellel aggregate oprations. 
Or we can simply say stream is simply an abstraction which focuses on all instead of the parts.
Stream API allows to abstract everything that we do before Java 8 example, writing loops, conditions etc.
Streams brings functional programmin to Java and are supported in Java 8.
Stream APIs are mostly used with collections.

Stream API consists of mainly 3 parts:
1. Source
2. Intermediate Operations
3. Terminal Operations
